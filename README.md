# Pricing_Land
Design:  The purpose of webpage  is to  display pricing information for fictious fiber service and it is design for specific purpose(landing page) to get user attention , I  used a  different elements to design  webpage in clean and  responsive  manner.A consistent color scheme is maintened for proffesional apperance and layout organized in ease navigation.
Feature:  To make the webapage responsive i used  meta  tag with  viewport element it has name and content attribute to rescaling size that adapt to respective device then I used a dropdown menu for  customization  of currency and    measurement unit based on user prefernece,toggle switch is used for month and annual plan and comprehesive pricing table is  defined . To make it dynamic  javascript play a crucial role to  update currency and measurement value  for pricing plan, atlast I used CTA(call to action) button as  to attract user to book plan.
Issue: I encountred problem is to place element in single webpage , because toggle switch is for month/annual plan then two drop down menu for currency  and measurement unit  if  i update in anyone of element then it effect in result as changing price with dynamically this is issue encountered.
